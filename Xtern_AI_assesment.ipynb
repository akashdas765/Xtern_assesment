    "### `read_data` Function\n",
    "\n",
    "The `read_data` function is utilized to read a CSV file and transform it into a machine-readable format. It accomplishes this by performing the following tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Reading Data from CSV:**\n",
    "   - Reads data from a CSV file specified by the `file` parameter using the Pandas library and stores it in a DataFrame named `data`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Printing the First 5 Rows:**\n",
    "   - Prints the first 5 rows of the DataFrame using `data.head()` to provide a quick preview of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Printing Data Information:**\n",
    "   - Prints information about the DataFrame using `data.info()`. This information includes data types of columns, the number of non-null values, and memory usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Printing Summary Statistics:**\n",
    "   - Prints summary statistics of the DataFrame using `data.describe()`. This includes count, mean, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum values for numerical columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Counting Missing Values:**\n",
    "   - Prints the count of missing values in each column using `data.isnull().sum()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Counting Unique Classes:**\n",
    "   - Prints the number of unique classes in the 'Order' column to provide an idea of the number of unique categories or labels in that specific column.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Label Encoding:**\n",
    "   - Performs label encoding on specific columns ('Year', 'Major', 'University', and 'Order') using scikit-learn's LabelEncoder. This step converts categorical data into numerical values, making it suitable for machine learning models that require numerical input.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Data Separation:**\n",
    "   - Separates the data into feature variables (X) and the target variable (y). It assumes that the last column in the DataFrame is the target variable. The X variable includes all columns except the last one, and the y variable contains the last column.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Data Splitting:**\n",
    "   - Splits the data into training and testing sets using scikit-learn's `train_test_split` function. It assigns 80% of the data to the training set (`X_train` and `y_train`) and 20% to the testing set (`X_test` and `y_test`).\n",
    "\n",
    "The `read_data` function is an essential data preparation step, transforming raw CSV data into a format suitable for machine learning, performing exploratory data analysis, and preparing the data for subsequent modeling and analysis.\n"

    "5. **Saving the Model:**\n",
    "   - Persists the trained Decision Tree model by saving it to a file named 'finalized_model_dtree.sav' using the `pickle.dump` function. This allows for future use of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Printing Accuracy and F1 Score:**\n",
    "   - Prints the accuracy and F1 score as percentages, rounded to two decimal places using the `print` function.\n",

    "7. **Returning Results:**\n",
    "   - Returns three values: accuracy, F1 score, and the filename under which the trained model is saved.\n",
